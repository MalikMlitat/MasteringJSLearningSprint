1. Compound Assignment With Augmented Multiplication
```js
let a = 5;
let b = 12;
let c = 4.6;

a *= 5;
b *= 3;
c *= 10;
```
2. Concatenating Strings with the Plus Equals Operator
```js
let myStr = "This is the first sentence."
myStr += " "
myStr += "This is the second sentence."
```
3. Use Bracket Notation to Find the Nth-to-Last Character in a String

};

console.log(dog.numLegs)
```
