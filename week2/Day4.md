## Classes, Prototypes - Object Oriented JavaScript


- Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that treats data as objects, which have properties and methods.
- In JavaScript, objects are created using the new keyword.
- The new keyword creates a new object and assigns it to a variable.
- The object's properties and methods can be accessed using dot notation.
- Objects can be nested, meaning that one object can be contained within another object.
- Prototypes are a way of sharing properties and methods between objects.
- When an object is created, it inherits the properties and methods of its prototype.
- The prototype chain is the sequence of prototypes that an object inherits from.
- The Object.prototype is the prototype of all objects in JavaScript.
- Classes are a way of creating objects that have a consistent structure.
- Classes are created using the class keyword.
- The class keyword defines a blueprint for an object.
- Objects created from a class are called instances of the class.
- Instances of a class inherit the properties and methods of the class.
- Classes can be nested, meaning that one class can be contained within another class.
- hasOwnerProperty method is helpful to identify if an object has a property
```js
user1.hasOwnProperty('name')
```
All objects have a _\_proto__ proerty by dafault which links to Object.prototype 
- this- and => keyword (already learned)
